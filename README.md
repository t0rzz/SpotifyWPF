## üöÄ Quick Start

### Windows
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF.git
cd SpotifyWPF
dotnet restore
dotnet build .\SpotifyWPF\SpotifyWPF.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project .\SpotifyWPF\SpotifyWPF.csproj
```

### macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF.git
cd SpotifyWPF/SpotifyWPF.macOS.native
chmod +x build_dmg.sh
./build_dmg.sh
# Install the generated .dmg file
```

## üì¶ Downloads

Head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF/releases) and download the appropriate artifact for your platform:

### Windows
- **MSIX installer**: Simplest install/uninstall experience on Windows 10/11
- **Portable EXE**: Single file, no installation required
- **ZIP**: Full build output for manual installation

### macOS
- **DMG installer**: Native macOS installer package
- Contains the complete SpofifyWPF application bundle

### Installing MSIX (developer build)

> These builds are signed with our **developer certificate** (`msix-signing.cer`).  
> Windows needs to trust this publisher once before installing.

**1) Download from the Release page**
- `SpofifyWPF-<version>.msix`
- `msix-signing.cer` (publisher certificate)

**2) Enable app sideloading (once)**
- Windows 10/11 ‚Üí *Settings* ‚Üí *Privacy & Security* ‚Üí *For developers* ‚Üí **Developer Mode** (or enable *Install apps from any source, including loose files*).

**3) Trust the certificate (Admin PowerShell)**
```powershell
# From the folder where you downloaded the files:
# Trust the publisher for app packages
Import-Certificate -FilePath .\msix-signing.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople

# Because it's self-signed, also trust as a root (often required)
Import-Certificate -FilePath .\msix-signing.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

## üîë Authentication

Both applications use OAuth 2.0 with the following required scopes:
- `user-read-private` - Read user profile information
- `user-read-email` - Read user email address
- `user-read-playback-state` - Read current playback state and devices
- `user-modify-playback-state` - Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume)
- `user-follow-read` - Read user's followed artists
- `user-follow-modify` - Follow/unfollow artists
- `user-library-read` - Read user's saved tracks and albums
- `user-library-modify` - Save/remove tracks and albums
- `user-top-read` - Read user's top tracks and artists
- `playlist-read-private` - Read user's private playlists
- `playlist-read-collaborative` - Read collaborative playlists
- `playlist-modify-public` - Create and modify public playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` - Create and modify private playlists
- `streaming` - Stream music and control playback (required for Web Playback SDK)

**Note**: Create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard if you need custom configuration.

- **OAuth Flow**: Consistent authentication experience
- **UI/UX Design**: Unified dark theme and interaction patterns

## üìã Development Notes

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- **API Layer**: Both platforms use the same Spotify Web API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Identical OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE
- **Features**: Core functionality is identical across platforms
- **UI Patterns**: Consistent interaction design and workflows

### Platform Differences
- **Build Process**: Windows uses .NET/MSBuild, macOS uses Xcode/Swift
- **Distribution**: MSIX vs DMG packaging
- **WebView**: WebView2 (Chromium) vs WKWebView (Safari)
- **Native Integration**: WPF controls vs SwiftUI/AppKit

## ü§ù Contributing

Both platforms welcome contributions! The core business logic is shared, so improvements to one platform often benefit both.

### Development Setup
1. **Windows**: Use Visual Studio 2022 with .NET desktop workload
2. **macOS**: Use Xcode 14+ with Swift 5.7+
3. **Cross-platform**: Web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) work on both platforms
