##  Quick Start - Spotify Playlist Management Setup

### Windows (SpofifyWPF) - Windows Spotify Bulk Operations
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF.git
cd SpotifyWPF
dotnet restore
dotnet build .\SpotifyWPF\SpotifyWPF.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project .\SpotifyWPF\SpotifyWPF.csproj
```

### macOS (SpofifyWPF) - macOS Spotify Playlist Organizer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF.git
cd SpotifyWPF/SpotifyWPF.macOS.native
chmod +x build_dmg.sh
./build_dmg.sh
# Install the generated .dmg file for advanced playlist management
```

## üì¶ Downloads - Spotify Power Tools Installation

Head to the [Releases page](https://github.com/t0rzz/SpotifyWPF/releases) and pick the appropriate artifact for your platform to start bulk playlist operations:

### Windows Downloads - Windows Spotify Playlist Management
- **MSIX installer**: Simplest install/uninstall experience on Windows 10/11 for playlist cleanup
- **Portable EXE**: Single file, no installation required for bulk operations
- **ZIP**: Full build output for manual installation of Spotify automation tools

### macOS Downloads - macOS Spotify Power Tools

## üîë Spotify Authentication

Both applications use the same OAuth flow:
- Automatic browser-based authentication
- Secure token storage and refresh
- **Required scopes** (all are necessary for full functionality):
  - `user-read-private` - Read user profile information
  - `user-read-email` - Read user email address
    > **Note**: Both `user-read-private` and `user-read-email` are required for the same API endpoint (`GET /me` - Get Current User's Profile). Spotify's API design bundles email access with basic profile access for security reasons, even if your app doesn't display the email address.
  - `user-read-playback-state` - Read current playback state and devices
  - `user-modify-playback-state` - Control playback (play, pause, skip, volume)
  - `user-follow-read` - Read user's followed artists
  - `user-follow-modify` - Follow/unfollow artists
  - `user-library-read` - Read user's saved tracks and albums
  - `user-library-modify` - Save/remove tracks and albums
  - `user-top-read` - Read user's top tracks and artists
  - `playlist-read-private` - Read user's private playlists
  - `playlist-read-collaborative` - Read collaborative playlists
  - `playlist-modify-public` - Create and modify public playlists
  - `playlist-modify-private` - Create and modify private playlists
